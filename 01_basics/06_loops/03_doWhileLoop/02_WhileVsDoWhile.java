// JavaJuice - Concept Demo: Difference between while and do-while loop

/*
 * üìù Concept Practice:
 * Demonstrate the difference between `while` and `do-while` loops.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * - Set i = 12 initially.
 * - Use a `while` loop that checks if i < 11 ‚Üí it won‚Äôt run.
 * - Then use a `do-while` loop with i = 12 ‚Üí it will run once.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Purpose: Show that `do-while` runs the loop at least once, even if the condition is false.

         * So this will run once even though i > 10.
